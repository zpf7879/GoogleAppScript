# GoogleAppScript
These are my frequently used Google Apps Scripts.
Go to https://script.google.com/home, create a project, and then add these files in the left-side "Files" menu. Remember to add "Drive API" into the Services in the left-side "Services" menu.

## FileAmountAndSizes
Calculate the amount and total size of files in a Google Drive folder.
